Array Challenge

Have the function ArrayChallenge(arr) take the arr parameter being passed which will be an array of non-negative integers and circularly rotate the array starting from the Nth element where N is equal to the first integer in the array. For example: if arr is [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 10] then your program should rotate the array starting from the 2nd position because the first element in the array is 2. The final array will therefore be [4, 1, 6, 10, 2, 3], and your program should return the new array as a string, so for this example your program would return 4161023. The first element in the array will always be an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than the size of the array. 
Once your function is working, take the final output string and concatenate it with your ChallengeToken, and then replace every third character with an X.
